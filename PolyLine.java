     * PolyLine constructor. A polyline is comprised of 4 points. It is effectively a parallelogram. A parellelogram
     * can be thought of as being defined by two parallel lines. It is defined here by a line given as two points
     * and a thickness defining the relative location of the parallel line. It has the following points:
     *  0: The "upper-left" (UL) point.
     *  1: The "upper-right" (UR) point.
     *  2: The "lower-right" point. This has the same x value as the upper-right but has a y value such that:
     *     lr.y = ur.y + thickness.
     *  3: The "lower-left" point. This has the same x value as the upper-left but has a y value such that:
     *     ll.y = ul.y + thickness.
     * 
     * @param pointUL The start point of the first line defining the PolyLine (parallelogram).
     * @param pointUR The end point of the first line defining the PolyLine (parallelogram).
     * @param thickness The number of pixels below the first line that the second line appears. Note that if a negative
     *                  value is given, the second line will be above the first line.
     * @param color The color of the PolyLine.
     * @param filled Whether or not the PolyLine is filled.
